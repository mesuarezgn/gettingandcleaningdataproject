# Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project Codebook

This file shows the data dictitionary of the information that can be found on the tidy_data.txt file.

#### 1. subject : 
  List the identifier assigned to the subjects that were part of the experiment. The sequence goes from 1 to 30.
  
#### 2. activity : identified activity
  List of the activities that were captured by the mobile devices while the subjects were doing some actions. There are 6 possible outcomes:
  * walking
  * walking_upstairs
  * walking_downstairs
  * sitting
  * standing
  * laying

#### 3. feature :
  List of variables captured by the accelerometer (Acc) and giroscope (Gyro) on 3-axial raw signals (XYZ).
  The "t" prefix denotes time domain signals and the "f" denotes frequency domain signals.

#### 4. meanavg :
  It shoes the mean average of each variable (feature) for each activity and each subject.
  
#### 5. stdavg :
  It shoes the standard deviation (std) average of each variable (feature) for each activity and each subject.
