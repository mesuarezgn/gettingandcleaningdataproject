# Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project
Final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera

## Assigment Description
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The data used was downloaded from the following link:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The purporse of the assigment was to create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Solution Approach
In this repository you will find the following files:
* README.md
* CodeBook.md
* run_analysis.R
* tidy_data.txt
